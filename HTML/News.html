            <h2>Oculus Quest Sales Reach $5 Million</h2>
            <p>
              In yet another development in what seems to be Oculus's full-speed
              takeover of the VR rise, sales of their Quest software have
              reached $5 million. The Quest software is starting to see
              'console-like usage', and the VR has become so motion capable,
              that Oculus is beginning to rethink the corded design of the
              Oculus Rift S.

              removing the headset, 6 cameras for quality tracking experience,
              and a modular face plate for swapping out different VR needs in

            <p>
              In what can be described as no small achievement, a developer
              working on a VR training program for police officers has moved
              their software into beta testing, with 20 police departments
              volunteering to test the software. "I owe this victory to SIXR and
              to my investors. I couldn't have done it without them." said the
              developer in a recent interview.

              SIXR Investor Speaks About Experience Investing in Entreprenuers
              and Startups
            </h2>
            <p>
              At a panel about the future of tech investments last week, one of
              our very own investors gave an interesting take on the climate:
              "Anyone interested in investing in tech should have their eyes on
              virtual reality. No corporate entity really controls the market
              outside of Oculus, so these startups have huge potential." said
              the Investor. "I invest through a platform called SIXR, and what
              these young developers are doing is no doubt the future."

            </h2>
            <p>
              Last month, we at SIXR hosted an event where we asked VR
              developers to come up with an idea that would help the world on a
              large scale. Today, we'd like to announce the winning project!
              Taking home the gold is Julia Smith's project, which is a VR
              program to train diving crews to clean debris underwater and
              rescue destressed wildlife caught in debris. As her prize, Julia
              will recieve full funding and backing for her project, and partner
              with some of the top VR developers in the country to bring this
              program to life.

            <h2>BitCoin Stock Surges Following Announcement from Facebook</h2>
            <p>
              BitCoin stock hit an 18-month high this morning, following an
              announcement from Facebook that they would be releasing their own
              cryptocurrency coin, the Libra. This high-point is the result of
              an eight day rise in crypto stock, as investors renew interest in
              cryptocurrency after a bruising 2018.

            <h2>SIXR Investor Meeting Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
              Today marked the end of the annual SIXR investor meeting, and the
              future couldn't be brighter. Some of the topics covered at the
              meeting including exciting up and coming projects, investment
              strategies for the VR landscape, and the importance of programs
              that provide a service over entertainment. While VR is an
              incredible entertainment platform that attracts many investors, it
              was clear in the meeting this year that focus is starting to shift
              on programs that help people, such as training programs or
              educational systems. Thank you to all our investors who attended,
              and we will see you next year!
