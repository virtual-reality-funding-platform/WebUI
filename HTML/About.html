            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              SIXR is a group committed to providing virtual reality content to
              the global community. Our Cinematic VR team is based in Seattle,
              Washington, and attract talent from the Pacific Northwest to spark
              creative growth for the VR industry. We provide a platform for VR
              entrepreneurs to seek funding for their projects, and for
              investors to find the right project to put their money in.
              Together, we strive to create a new frontier by expanding the
              world of virtual reality and making it accessible to anyone and
              everyone.

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
              At SIXR, we seek to accomplish two goals; to attract talented
              developers looking to build new and exciting VR projects, and to
              provide a way for those developers to have their projects funded
              and make their dreams come true. This is accomplished by seeking
              'angel investors', or people who are looking for the next up and
              coming project to invest in. By combining these people into one
              platform, We allow VR developers to easily get their projects
              funded, and for investors to track the progress of their
              investment in real time by seeing it come alive right on our
              webpage.
